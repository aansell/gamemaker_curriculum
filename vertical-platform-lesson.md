# GameMaker: Vertical Platform with Collision Hints and Sticky Property

[... previous sections remain unchanged ...]

## Task Overview
1. Create a vertical platform object
2. Implement vertical platform movement
3. Handle player collision with the vertical platform
4. Implement techniques to prevent falling through the platform
5. Add a "sticky" property to the platform

[... sections 1-4 remain unchanged ...]

### 5. Add a "sticky" property to the platform
We'll modify the platform and player objects to implement a sticky property, allowing the player to stay on the platform even when it moves down.

a. In the obj_platform_vertical's Create event, add:
```gml
sticky = true;  // Set to false if you want non-sticky platforms
```

b. In the player's Step event, after the collision check with the platform:
```gml
var platform = instance_place(x, y + vsp, obj_platform_vertical);
if (platform != noone) {
    if (bbox_bottom <= platform.bbox_top) {
        y = platform.bbox_top - (bbox_bottom - y);
        vsp = 0;
        
        // Sticky platform behavior
        if (platform.sticky) {
            // Move with the platform
            y += platform.vspeed;
            
            // Prevent player from "sticking" to the bottom of the platform
            if (!place_meeting(x, y, platform) && platform.vspeed < 0) {
                y = platform.bbox_bottom + 1;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

c. To allow the player to jump off the platform, modify your jump code:
```gml
if (keyboard_check_pressed(vk_space)) {
    var platform = instance_place(x, y + 1, obj_platform_vertical);
    if (place_meeting(x, y + 1, obj_solid) || (platform != noone && platform.sticky)) {
        vsp = -jump_speed;
    }
}
```

This implementation allows the player to:
- Stay on the platform as it moves up and down
- Jump off the platform at any point
- Fall off the edge of the platform naturally
- Not get stuck to the bottom of the platform when it moves up

## Challenges
1. Create a platform that changes direction when the player lands on it
2. Implement a platform that accelerates and decelerates smoothly
3. Add a visual indicator (like dust particles) when the player is "stuck" to the platform

## Reflection Questions
1. How does the sticky property change the gameplay dynamics compared to non-sticky platforms?
2. Can you think of any puzzle mechanics that could be created using a mix of sticky and non-sticky platforms?
3. What challenges might you face if you wanted to implement sticky behavior for horizontal or diagonal moving platforms?

Remember, implementing smooth platform mechanics often requires a lot of tweaking and testing. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work perfectly right away â€“ keep refining your code and testing different scenarios!
